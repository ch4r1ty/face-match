# face-match
## WHAT IS IT
Face-Match is a program aiming at face comparison



## TOOLS
[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

[face_recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition)




## FILE DESCRIPTION
~~**'main.py'**: Do not read it plz, it's completely shitty code!ðŸ¤®ðŸ¤® It is where the coder first coded all the lines in one python file~~

~~**'app.py'**: Linked to 'main.py'ðŸ¤®ðŸ¤®~~

~~**'function.py'**: The coder packages functions in 'main.py' in one functionðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š~~

**'main.py'**: It is the most vital code in the project! Many little functions are decomposed from one single function in 'function.py'ðŸ¥µðŸ¥µ

**'app.py'**: Linked to 'test.py', not badðŸ¥µðŸ¥µ

**'parameter.py'**: Adjust the tolerance. The higher the tolerance(between 0 to 1), the simpler the system will recognize faces.

## UPDATE

### 07/31/2023

To improve the efficiency of the program, by saving face-encodings in a new file: **'face_encodings.pkl'**, instead of getting all the know_face_encodings each time when posts a request.
